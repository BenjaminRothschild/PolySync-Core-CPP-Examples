### SerialWriter
You would use this as a reference if you needed a node to talk directly to a device over a serial connection.
It pairs nicely with the `SerialReader` example.
This example creates and writes data to a serial connection, to a hardware device, or another software application.

### Hardware requirements

### Dependencies

### Building and Running the Node
```bash
$ cd SerialWriter 
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./polysync-serial-writer-cpp
```
