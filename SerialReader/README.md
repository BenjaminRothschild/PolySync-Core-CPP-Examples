### SerialReader
You would use this as a reference if you needed a node to listen to a device over a serial connection.
This example creates and reads data through a serial connection, to a hardware device, or another software application.
It exercises the Serial API.
It pairs nicely with the `SerialWriter` example.

### Hardware requirements

### Dependencies

### Building and Running the Node
```bash
$ cd SerialReader 
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./polysync-serial-reader-cpp
```
