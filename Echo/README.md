### Echo
This is more of a tool then an example; it is a lightweight way of printing what messages are on the bus from the command line.
The help output of this tool is very verbose and is the best way to get acquainted with its functionality.
Sometimes this tools gets bogged down with very large message types such as `ps_lidar_points_msg`.
